#   TDD Start

## install pytest
    pip install pytest

## run test command
    python3 -m pytest tests

## code file text/tools.py
## test file tests/test_string/test_tools.py

## very important notice:
the code should be written in a way to be testable like break it down into functions instead of writing the code in a big bunch of one unit
